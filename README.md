# Algorithm Visualizer
ReactJS project that brings to life path finding and sorting algorithms in computer science.
Inspired by Clement Mihailescu, featuring my implementation using ReactJS instead of vanilla Javascript. <br />

## About
An interactive web application that features:
  * Path Finding Algorithms that compute paths between a starting point and a destination point. Users can draw their own graphs before running the algorithms.
  * Maze generation using recursive division.
  * Sorting Algorithms that arrange a list of integers in ascending order.
  * Pausing and adjustment of the algorithm speed to see each execution step.

## Path Finding Algorithms
  * Depth First Search
  * Breadth First Search
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * Astar Algorithm (Manhattan Hieuristic)

## Sorting Algorithms
  * Selection Sort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quick Sort (Rightmost Pivot)
  * Merge Sort
  * Gravity Sort

## Ideas for Future Extension
  * Display of pseudo-code during algorithm execution.
  * Step through algorithm execution.
  * Data structures visualization like linked list and binary trees.
